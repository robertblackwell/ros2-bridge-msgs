# ROS2 Bridge Msgs

This project is a ROS2 package that holds the custom messages required by the repo (https://github.com/robertblackwell/ros2-serial-bridge)[https://github.com/robertblackwell/ros2-serial-bridge].

I will add to this file in the near term with info about how to install the three repos required to demonstrate a serial link between a Pi Pico and a desktop running Ubuntu.
